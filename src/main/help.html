	<h1>Welcome to the help page!</h1>
</section>
<section>
	<p align='left'>I made it just for you, and I hope you like it.
	<br></br> The goal of this help page is to... well, help.
	I think that should be pretty understandable; it's good
	to be helpful. Do unto others as you would have them do
	unto you, right? I've heard Canadians are more helpful 
	than Americans, and I'm out to prove them wrong. Later,
	though. For now I'm just making the page.<br></br>Also
	a shoutout to our favorite dude, St. Jude, the patron Saint 
	of hopeless causes - like my other task!</p>
